# Readme

The main purpose is document some mini-projects in rust, improve problem-solving skills and software design while I'm tinkering with a few good libraries (e.g. currently `iced-rs`) in `Rust` language.

## Todo

1. Re-organize the repo into workspace structure.
2. Choose one of the following examples based on complexity.

- [ ] Todo MVC

`challenges`:
